                <p>San Juan Health Service District is a small hospital and two clinics that were in need of a new website to help show a more professional presence to locals and visitors of southeastern Utah.</p>
                <p>I implemented a new website, leveraging WordPress and front-end web languages to transform a 30+ page site to what it is today, including online job form and other online form submissions from the previous paper or fax alternatives.</p>

                <h3 class="centerElement">BYU AIS</h3>
                <p>The BYU AIS club previously had a Python Django implementation but because the site didnâ€™t need to have any business logic, I decided to simplify the site to a Wordpress implementation. Through using the CMS and basic HTML, CSS, and JS, I was able to make the site more simple to manage, especially for quick edits, as the owner of the site is constantly changing.</p>
